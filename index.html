                <p>
                    Pocket Network is a crypto project that aims to create a kind of “decentralized Infura''. Infura is
                    a
                    consensus product that allows any blockchain developer of a decentralized application to connect
                    directly to Ethereum or other blockchain nodes using a very simple API without having to launch
                    their own node.

                    At Infura, you pay a certain amount for each API request. Thus, this is a great business for Infura,
                    because they lease the nodes, and it is profitable for the developers, because they do not have to
                    deal with the support of the nodes. Usually companies are obliged to pay for it. In addition, the
                    support of nodes is associated with certain risks – the data centers, electricity, and the Internet
                    can be turned off at any moment. Nowadays the blockchain is so advanced that you don't need to
                    maintain your own nodes for your service, especially when it comes to small startups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Infura has monopolized the market, and at the moment, Infura is connected to 25% to 50% of
                    all global blockchain applications. On the one hand, this is good, because the owner of Infura is a
                    solid company ConsenSys, but on the other hand, there is no decentralization. The blockchain itself
                    is decentralized, but the access point to the blockchain – Infura – is centralized. This is the only
                    node that keeps consensus, but only developers have access to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, when you work with an application through MetaMask, it is connected to Infura. When you
                    enter MetaMask and your wallet balance is loaded, the information does not come directly from the
                    blockchain, but Infura takes data from the blockchain and transfers it to MetaMask. There are two
                    possibilities for getting data from the blockchain: either you can be the blockchain node that
                    stores the entire blockchain, or deal with Infura, the node that you pay to provide the data.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12 info-block">
                <p>
                    Some companies don't want to deal with Infura because it breaks down regularly. This is a serious
                    problem. Decentralization is the solution. But how do you make Infura decentralized? Pocket Network
                    developers have come up with the following model: node-operators of Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot,
                    Avalanche and other blockchains are engaged in mining. They are given the opportunity to earn extra
                    money through the fact that they provide their own nodes to third-party developers to use in
                    Infura-like fashion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pocket Network has created a payment gateway that charges users a fee for each request addressed to
                    these nodes, and they receive payment in POKT tokens. Thus, Pocket Network provides exactly the same
                    service as Infura, but instead of a single centralized node, there are hundreds or thousands of
                    nodes. For miners, keeping a node is their main business, because if they go offline, they do not
                    receive a block reward. Even if one node crashes, there are many others that process requests
                    addressed to that non-functioning node. This way, the running state of the application is always
                    maintained.

                        POKT, the native Pocket Network token, is hosted on the Tendermint blockchain, which is
                        connected to the Cosmos blockchain. But the problem is that no matter what blockchain your token
                        is issued on, it must be duplicated on the Ethereum blockchain, where the bulk of the money is
                        concentrated. Otherwise, it will be difficult to raise capital, and it will be difficult for
                        token holders to use them for speculation, investment, etc. Tokens are duplicated through a
                        bridge.

                        Pocket Network develops a bridge application, thanks to which users can send a POKT token to the
                        address of the bridge. This token is burned, and a wrapped POKT token, which correlates with the
                        POKT token at a one-to-one rate, is created.This wrapped POKT token is issued on Ethereum. If
                        the user wants to do the reverse conversion, he returns a wrapped POKT token, which is burned
                        and a regular POKT token is issued. This is how tokens migrate between blockchains, and Boosty
                        Labs creates a bridge for this.
